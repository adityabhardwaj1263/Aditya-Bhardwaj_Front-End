Explain what the simple List component does.

Answer:-
In React, the Simple List component is a component that renders a list of items in a simple format. It is typically used to display a collection of related items,
such as a list of products or a list of blog posts.Lists are used to display data in an ordered format and mainly used to display menus on websites. In React, 
Lists can be created in a similar way as we create lists in JavaScript.
The Simple List component takes an array of items as a prop and then renders each item in the list using the map() method. Each item in the array is typically an 
object with properties that correspond to the data to be displayed for that item.
